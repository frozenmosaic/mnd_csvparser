Hi,

I'm writing a small script to parse CSV information and store it in a database.
I'm not using any framework since this is a small project, but I use Codeception to test my code.

Basically what my class Parser does is parsing data from a CSV file, process the data (put it more neatly into arrays) and insert that data.

I wrote the class
